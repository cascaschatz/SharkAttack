# SharkAttack
Project Name

## Active
Project status(Active, On-Hold, Completed)

## Project objective
To practice tools and procedures learned during data cleaning and manipulation classes in Ironhack bootcamp. 

### Paragraph with introduction/ objective of project

Sharks are one of the most feared creatures in the world. The goal of this dataset is to inform people about the risks associated with coastal water activities and to improve shark/human relations by educating people on factors that contribute to shark attacks. The analysis looked, specially, into the relationship between the number of events and the moon phases, the seasons of the year and the land-ocean temperature.

### Methods
First cleaning
Raise a question
More cleaning and preparing data to answer the question 
Raise a second question
More cleaning and preparing data to answer the second question

### List with used technologies, ex:

Python
Pandas


### Paragraph with a description of the dataset, sources, characteristics ,etc.
It was used 3 datasets, all of them found on Kaggle:
Shark Attack - A table of shark attack incidents compiled by the Global Shark Attack File.
Moon Calendar - The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. There are exactly 1,867 full moons between 1900 and 2050. 
Land-Ocean - The change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures in data from Nasa.
